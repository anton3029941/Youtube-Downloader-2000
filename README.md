# Youtube-Downloader-2000
simple yt downloader. Made with the help of chat gpt for my needs. Maybe it will be useful for someone too.  

to run programm you need python 3.8+  

Run file with python  

And you need download cookies from youtube, put it in folder with file and name it cookies.txt or cookies if you don't see file extensions. To do this I use chrome extension "Get cookies.txt LOCALLY"  

if you can't paste the url, try changing your keyboard layout to English  

downloaded files will be located in \Youtube-Downloader-2000-main\downloads
